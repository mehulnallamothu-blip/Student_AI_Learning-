# Learning App (scaffold)

This is a scaffolding of the kid-friendly learning web app (client + server + shared schema) based on the content you uploaded.

What I created:
- `server/` minimal Express TypeScript server with routes using your uploaded routes.ts as a reference.
- `client/` Vite React + TypeScript skeleton with `App.tsx` and `index.css` snippets taken from your file.
- `shared/` contains `schema.ts` excerpt from your upload.

Next steps to run locally:
1. Install Node 18+ and npm.
2. From the project root:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev`
3. Open the client dev URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) and the server on http://localhost:3000.

Deployment guidance is included in the final message.

Note: This is a scaffold — some components are placeholders. You will need to wire up real storage (Postgres, Supabase, or similar) and fill out activities, assets, and icons.

I used your uploaded `app replit.md` to build parts of this scaffold. fileciteturn0file0
